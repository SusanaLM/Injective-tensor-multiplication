This reposity contains the code of the paper "Computation of Tensor Functions under Tensor-Tensor Multiplications with Linear Maps"
## Contents


* **Overview**
  - Injective SVD under a Johnson-Lindenstrauss-type embedding provides similar performance to the surjective SVD with a data-dependent matrix when the truncation $k$ is high.
